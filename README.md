# Adhesion-Buddy
Adhesion Buddy is a tool specifically crafted for enhancing the 3D printing process by addressing the critical factor of bed adherence. Through a meticulously designed 3D print file, it initiates the creation of nine towers distributed strategically across the printer's bed area. Following the printing process, it facilitates a comprehensive assessment of bed adherence by employing a methodical approach. This involves cooling the printer nozzle to ensure stability and subsequently applying controlled pressure to each tower. By subjecting the bed to such scrutiny, Adhesion Buddy effectively gauges the adherence levels in various regions surrounding the build area, offering valuable insights to optimize printing conditions and ensure consistent print quality.
